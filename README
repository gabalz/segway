A robot segway simulator with OpenGL visualization.

The first version of the simulator was developed by Gabor Balazs
during the experimental robotics course of Csaba Szepesvari in 2011-2012.
The goal of the course was to teach system identification, control and
localization by particle filtering based on known maps.

In the simulator, one can control a robot segway on a flat terrain.
The robot's design is based on the HiTechnic HTWay robot
(http://www.hitechnic.com/blog/gyro-sensor/htway/).
The robot is equipped with a rate gyroscope, 2 DC motors and 3 IR sensors.

The code provides a slightly modified version of the HTWay controller
and an adaptive particle filter for localization
(D. Fox: KLD-Sampling: Adaptive Particle Filters, 2001).

The controllers are split to robot and PC parts, where the robot part deals
with critical and computationally cheap tasks (PID control, transmitting
sensor readings) and the PC part performs higher level operations (particle
filtering, user input, visualization). So the code can be easily transferred
to a real HTWay type real robot. Videos about such a real robot (using the
same visualization as the simulator) can be found here:

The particle filter initially scans a grid over the map for all robot
orientations (the robot is assumed to stand close to vertical at start)
and initializes the particle cloud by the 10,000 most likely findings
("Searching..." phase). The 3 plots at the bottom of the screen show the
IR sensor readings (green) and the filter's estimate (red).

Using a non-default java:

    Just simply set the JAVA_HOME variable.

    Using bash:
    
        export JAVA_HOME=/.../jdk<version>
        export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

Tested with the following libraries and java versions:

    LWJGL 2.9.1 (http://legacy.lwjgl.org/)

Compiling the source:

    Download and unzip lwjgl-2.9.1.zip in the lib directory.
    Then issue:

    ant compile

Running the code:

    remote control without localization:

        ant drive

    remote control with localization:

        ant localize

    keys and mouse control:

        space              : run/pause
        left/right/up/down : drive the segway
        escape             : exit
        
        left click + move mouse   : rotate around view center
        middle click + move mouse : zoom in/out
        right click + move mouse  : translate view center position

Cleaning the source (delete binaries):

    ant clean
